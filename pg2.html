          You know sometimes I wonder, in another universe are we laughing about
          how in this universe we are apart, or have we ever met in noher
          universe? But what ever in happens in those universes it is not of
          much worry cause I am grateful that you are here with me in this
          universe, no matter how far, but you are here with me, and have been
          here, and will be, even if only in the memories, but you will always
          be here.
        </main>
      </div>

        I hope we meet in all possible lives, all possible universes, and if I
        ever get the chance, I do want to become your classmate, and your
        brother, again
